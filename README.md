# Serp Tracker
=======

To learn a little bit of NodeJS and nw.js and for fun I developed search engine ranking position tracker.

## Starting the server app

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the application and create an sqlite database in your app dir.
REST API will be available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Starting the client app (nw.js with angular)

```
npm run client
```
